# My configuration files

Here are my configuration files for .bashrc .vimrc etc. A lot of these are taken from other people's repositories, tutorials, video lessons and on-line articles. 
I am grateful for all the free materials out there. As I am learning, I am using this repository to both keep revision history of my config file and make them
available to others who may find them useful.
